# flowershop
I made my website from a flower shop in Helsinki, which is located in Kruunuvuori. 
The purpose of the website is to provide the most important information about the flower shop, 
so that visiting the place would be as effortless as possible. At the beginning of the website, 
you will be told which day and what time the flower shop is open. There are also pictures of different bouquets, 
what it is possible to get. Also listed below are the flowers that are available as well as their purposes and situations
for which the flowers in question are the right choice. At the bottom of the page, there is also a video about planting potted plants,
for lovers of green plants. 

In my work, I mainly used html5, but also java script and css. 
Peculiarities in my work were e.g. Navigation bar, style element, Slideshow barren cell, columns, card groups and linked video.
